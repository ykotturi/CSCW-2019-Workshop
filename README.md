## Workshop overview

While the shift to on-demand labor may foster greater control over one’s employment in some ways, it has removed much of the benefits that come with consistently working in shared physical spaces. Working in physical spaces allow opportunities for social support, earning, long-term growth, and stability. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate a discussion around how physical spaces and online technologies influence each other in on-demand work. We plan to invite a diversity of stakeholders, including grassroots organizers who can represent and voice the concerns of their respective worker communities, researchers studying these topics, and designers of on-demand work platforms. Discussion and ideas generated from this workshop will be archived online and made available to the larger research community and the general public.

## Guiding questions

- How might the on-demand nature of work help and/or hinder long-term stability, planning, and overall satisfaction?
- How might physical spaces augment on-demand work? 
- How does the on-demand nature of work change physical spaces of work? 
- How do we build a sense of shared “place” as work becomes more on-demand and distributed?

## Workshop goals

- **Reflect** on trends in research and practice with respect to the “de-placing” of work through on-demand digital mediation. 
- **Ideate** opportunities for how physical places (e.g. local organizations, community centers, co-working spaces) could address challenges and risks related to on-demand work.
- **Prototype** concrete plans or takeaways that the CSCW, and broader, community can takeaway when considering the role of “place” in on-demand work. 

We plan to write up a report on the outcomes of this workshop in the form of an ACM Communications article and corresponding blog post.

### Workshop activities

This workshop will be highly interactive, involving a mix of presentations, discussions, and hands-on activities. The majority of time will be dedicated to the following activities:  

- **Activity 1: Reflect** Participants will break into groups of 3-4. Each group will reflect on a certain probing question, such as one of the following: What has the CSCW community done thus far to build a better future, or at least counter the risks, that come with on-demand work? As traditional places are being disrupted, what other categories of places are popping up? Towards the end of this activity, each group will be asked to report out their reflection, which the organizers will help to live synthesize.
- **Activity 2: Ideate** In different groups of 3-4, participants will ideate opportunities and models for where technology and physical spaces could work in conjunction with each other to address some of the topics identified in the reflection activity. Participants will be asked to keep in mind what they can learn or adopt from other disciplines, fields, and industries. Goals of the ideation could include identifying supports for information sharing, learning, trust, and community.
- **Activity 3: Prototype** Continuing with groups in Activity 2, participants will perform a deep dive into one idea. This could take the form of a digital tool, a set of principles, implications for policy, a novel organizational structure, new categories of place, etc.

## Organizers

**Julie Hui** is an Assistant Professor/Presidential Post-doc at the University of Michigan School of Information. She has seven years of experience investigating how to best support peer information sharing and social support in informal work contexts, such as online crowdfunding communities, makerspaces, and neighborhood business groups. She is currently studying and building tools to support skill and self-efficacy development among low-resourced entrepreneurs.  

**Justin Cranshaw** is a researcher at Microsoft focusing on building and studying technologies to make individuals, teams, and organizations more productive at work. This workshop topic on the role of place in on-demand work bridges his current research interests to his past research, which focused on designing location-based social technologies for strengthening and supporting places, especially in an urban context.   

**Yasmine Kotturi** is a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie-Mellon. Last summer at Etsy, she investigated how thousands of Etsy sellers (based in the U.S., U.K., and India) organically leverage their peers to navigate the many uncertainties that arise in digitally-mediated work. With Community Forge, a co-working space in Wilkinsburg, PA, she is working to offer training courses on computer literacy and digital labor platforms to strengthen employability within the local community.   

**Chinmay Kulkarni** is an Assistant Professor of Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie-Mellon, where he directs the Expertise@Scale lab. In his research, Chinmay introduces new collaborative computer systems that help people learn and work better; typically, these systems use the large scale of participation to yield benefits that are otherwise not achievable.

 ## About CSCW
  
The 22nd ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2019) will be held November 9th-13th 2019, Austin, Texas.

“CSCW is the premier venue for research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities.”
