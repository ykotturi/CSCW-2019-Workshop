## Workshop Overview

While the shift to on-demand labor may foster greater control over one’s employment in some ways, it has removed much of the benefits that come with consistently working in shared physical spaces. Working in physical spaces allow opportunities for social support, earning, long-term growth, and stability. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate a discussion around how physical spaces and online technologies influence each other in on-demand work (e.g. ridesharing, crowd work, freelancing, side hustles). We plan to invite a diversity of stakeholders, including grassroots organizers who can represent and voice the concerns of their respective worker communities, researchers studying these topics, and designers of on-demand work platforms. Discussion and ideas generated from this workshop will be archived online and made available to the larger research community and the general public.  

**When:**  
Saturday, November 9, 2019  
9am-5pm

**Where:**  
Hilton Hotel  
500 East 4th Street  
Austin, TX 78701
  
### Guiding Questions

- How might the on-demand nature of work help and/or hinder long-term stability, planning, and overall satisfaction for workers?
- How might physical spaces augment on-demand work? 
- How does the on-demand nature of work change physical spaces of work? 
- How do we build a sense of shared “place” as work becomes more on-demand and distributed?

### Goals

- **Reflect** on trends in research and practice with respect to the “de-placing” of work through on-demand digital mediation. 
- **Ideate** opportunities for how physical places (e.g. local organizations, community centers, co-working spaces) could address challenges and risks related to on-demand work.
- **Prototype** concrete plans or takeaways that the CSCW, and broader, community can takeaway when considering the role of “place” in on-demand work. 

### Activities

This workshop will be highly interactive, involving a mix of presentations, discussions, and hands-on activities. The majority of time will be dedicated to the following activities:  

- **Activity 1: Reflect** Participants will break into groups of 3-4. Each group will reflect on a certain probing question, such as one of the following: What has the CSCW community done thus far to build a better future, or at least counter the risks, that come with on-demand work? As traditional places are being disrupted, what other categories of places are popping up? Towards the end of this activity, each group will be asked to report out their reflection, which the organizers will help to synthesize.
- **Activity 2: Ideate** In groups of 3-4, participants will ideate opportunities and models for where technology and physical spaces could work in conjunction with each other to address some of the topics/challenges identified in the reflection activity. Participants will be asked to keep in mind what they can learn or adopt from other disciplines, fields, and industries.
- **Activity 3: Prototype** Continuing with groups in Activity 2, participants will perform a deep dive into one idea. This could take the form of a digital tool, a set of principles, implications for policy, a novel organizational structure, new categories of place, etc.

The outcomes of these activities will contribute to a collective report on challenges and opportunities around the the de-placing of on-demand work.
